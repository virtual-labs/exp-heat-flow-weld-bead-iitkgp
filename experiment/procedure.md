## Procedure
- Before starting the process read the instructions completely
- Press Start button to start the simulator.
- Select the type of welding speed 2 mm/s or 4 mm/s .
- Observe the Temperature Vs Time plot.
- Hover on the plot to see the temparature variation with time.
- Below the plot observe the Peak temperature values.
- Click on the Stop button to stop the simulation.

## Discussion:
Calculate the peak temperature by using the following formula.

$$ \frac{1}{T_p-T_o}=\frac{4.132*C*\rho *t*x}{H_{net}}+\frac{1}{T_m-T_o} $$ <br><br>

              Where,<br>
             \\( T_p \\) =    Peak temperature (K) <br>
             \\( T_o \\)=    Ambient temperature of the workpiece (K) <br>
             \\(  \rho \\) =    density of the workpiece (g/mm<sup>3</sup>) <br>
             \\( C  \\) =    specific heat of the workpiece (J/g K <sup>-1</sup>) <br>
             \\( t   \\)  =    workpiece thickness (mm) <br>
             \\( x   \\) =    distance from weld centre line (mm) <br>
             \\( T_m \\)=    Melting temperature of the workpiece (K) <br>
             \\( H_{net}  =   \frac{q}{v} \\) in (J/m) <br>  <br>
             Where, <br>  \\( q \\)= heat or energy (J/s) <br>
             \\( v \\)= Welding speed (m/s) <br> <br>
   
Compare the peak temperature obtained from the formula with Virtual experimental result <br><br>

     Take material as mild steel<br>
     \\(  t = 6 mm \\)<br>
     \\( T_o= 298K\\)<br>
     \\( \rho = 0.008 g/mm^3 \\)<br>
     \\( C= 0.5107896 J/g  K^{-1} \\)<br>
     \( q= 1589.92J/s \\)<br>
         Assume distance from the weld centre line as   5, 10, and 15mm.
