## Procedure
- Before starting the process read the instructions completely
- Press **Start** button to start the simulator.
- Select the type of welding speed ***2 mm/s*** or ***4 mm/s*** .
- Observe the ***Temperature Vs Time*** plot.
- Hover on the plot to see the temparature variation with time.
- Below the plot observe the ***Peak temperature*** values.
- Click on the ***Stop*** button to stop the simulation.

## Discussion:
Calculate the peak temperature by using the following formula.

$$ \frac{1}{T_p-T_o}=\frac{4.132* C * \rho * t * x}{H_{net}}+\frac{1}{T_m-T_o} $$

Where,

\\( T_p \\) =    Peak temperature (K)
\\( T_o \\)=    Ambient temperature of the workpiece (K)
\\(  \rho \\) =    density of the workpiece (g/mm<sup>3</sup>)
\\( C  \\) =    specific heat of the workpiece (J/g K <sup>-1</sup>)
\\( t   \\)  =    workpiece thickness (mm)
\\( x   \\) =    distance from weld centre line (mm)
\\( T_m \\)=    Melting temperature of the workpiece (K)
\\( H_{net}  =   \frac{q}{v} \\) in (J/m)

Where, 

\\( q \\)= heat or energy (J/s)
\\( v \\)= Welding speed (m/s)
   
Compare the peak temperature obtained from the formula with Virtual experimental result 

Take material as mild steel

\\(  t = 6 mm \\)
\\( T_o= 298K\\)
\\( \rho = 0.008 g/mm^3 \\)
\\( C= 0.5107896 J/g  K^{-1} \\)
\\( q= 1589.92J/s \\)
Assume distance from the weld centre line as   5, 10, and 15mm.
